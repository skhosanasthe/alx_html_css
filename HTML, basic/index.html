                <h1>What to expect</h1>
                <p>Based on what I've seen so far, the program is quite intense, and requires your full commitment if you plan on making it through.</p>
                <h2>Mindset required for the program</h2>
                <p>Anyone who wants to succeed in this program needs to be open minded and forget all the preconceived notions of what software engineering actually is and how easy  it is to learn.
                    <br>
                    Everyone learns at a different pace and you have to find the best way to effectively learn concepts in order to become a competent software engineer.
                    </p>
